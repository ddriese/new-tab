## Installation

1. Download and extract ZIP file.
2. Take screenshots of the sites you'd like to appear.

  Save them to the **images** folder with an easily identifiable name (e.g. reddit.jpg).

  Ideally, you will want all of your screenshots to share the same dimensions (width x height).
3. Go to the Chrome Extensions settings ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)).
4. Turn on **Developer Mode**.
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Browse to the new-tab folder.

You can now use New Tab, just open a new tab and click **SETTINGS** in the top right to add your site info.

Note that the **image** field should contain the file name of screenshot you want to use for that site (e.g. reddit.jpg).
