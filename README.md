## Installation

1. Download and extract ZIP file.
2. Take screenshots of the sites you'd like to appear and save them to the **images** folder with an easily identifiable name (e.g. reddit.jpg).  Ideally, you will want all of your screenshots to share the same dimensions (width x height).
3. Go to the Chrome Extensions settings (<a href="chrome://extensions" target="_blank">chrome://extensions</a>).
4. Turn on **Developer Mode**.
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Browse to and select the **new-tab-master** folder.

You can now begin to use New Tab! Simply open a new tab and click **SETTINGS** in the top right to add your site info.

Note that the **image** field for each site should contain the file name of screenshot you want to use for that site (e.g. reddit.jpg).  Alternatively, you can link directly to an online image by pasting the entire image address in the field.
