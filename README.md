## Installation

**Before installing**, take screenshots of the sites you'd like to appear on New Tab and save them with easily identifiable names (e.g. reddit.jpg).

Ideally, all screenshots should share the same dimensions (width x height).

From there, you are ready to install New Tab:

1. Download and extract the ZIP file to your preferred location.
2. Move your screenshots to the **images** folder *or* upload them to https://imgur.com.
3. Go to the Chrome Extensions settings:
    - ![More](https://imgur.com/lsNg3v3.png) > More Tools > Extensions, *or*
    - Enter the following URL in the address bar: <a href="chrome://extensions" target="_blank">chrome://extensions</a>.
4. Turn on **Developer Mode**.
5. Click **Load unpacked**.
6. Browse to and select the **new-tab-master** folder.

You can now begin to use New Tab! Simply open a new tab and click the settings icon in the top right to customize.

## Settings

### Weather

By default, the weather conditions will be based on your approximate location given your current IP address.  You can override this and set a static location by entering both the latitude and longitude in the appropriate fields.

Note that the weather widget requires you generate and enter an API key in the settings.  You can sign up for an API key at https://darksky.net/dev/register.

### Sites

**Image** field:

- If you stored your screenshots in the **images** folder, simply enter the file name of the screenshot you'd like to use (e.g. reddit.jpg) in the **Image** field.

- If you **uploaded** your screenshots to an image hosting website (e.g. imgur.com), paste the entire image location for the screenshot you'd like to use into the **Image** field.

## Enhancement Suggestions

Below are future enhancements that are under consideration:

- [ ] Support for up to 10 sites
- [ ] Dynamic light/dark mode based on the time of day (enabled in settings)
- [ ] Cycle through multiple search engines by pressing tab in the search box
- [ ] Automagic screenshots based on URL entered in settings
